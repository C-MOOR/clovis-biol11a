## Introduction
Histograms are a useful way to get an overview of the shape of your data in a single dimension.

## Discrete values

You can make a histogram in R using the `hist` command.  Here is a vector of data that we want to plot a histogram of:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mtcars$cyl
```

The `hist` command takes a vector and plots out a histogram of the values in that vector:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(mtcars$cyl)
```

For histograms, the x-axis contains the **values** of the data that your plotting, and the y-axis (i.e. the height of the bars) tells you **how many times** that value appeared in your data.

From this graph, if we find **6** on the x axis, we can look at its bar and see that it has a height of 7.  This means that the value 6 showed up 7 times in the vector `mtcars$cyl`.

```{r, mtcars-histogram, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Interpret a histogram",
  question("How many times did the value **4** show up in the `mtcars$cyl` vector?",
    answer("0"),
    answer("4"),  
    answer("7"),
    answer("11", correct=TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("How many times did the value **5** show up in the `mtcars$cyl` vector?",
    answer("0", correct=TRUE),
    answer("4"),  
    answer("7"),
    answer("11"),
    allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Continuous values

So far we've looked at histograms of discrete (integer) values, but you can also make a histogram of continuous values.  Instead of having one bar for each number, each bar represents a range of numbers, for example, all the values between 10 and 15:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
mtcars$mpg
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

From this graph, we can see that there are 6 entries in the vector `mtcars$mpg` with a value between 10 and 15.

### Histogram of continuous values, larger datasets

For small datasets like `mtcars`, histograms might not seem that useful - it's pretty easy to just look at all the values in the vector and get a good sense of what's in there.  But histograms can be quite useful for summarizing large datasets.  Here is a histogram of Petal Length from the `iris` dataset, which has measurements from 150 different iris flowers.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(iris$Petal.Length)
```

From this graph we can see that there are a lot of flowers with Petal Lengths between 1 and 1.5 cm, several between 1.5 and 2 cm, not many at all between 2 and 3 cm, and several ranging from 4-6 cm.  This gives us a nice quick look at some general patterns in the data, and suggests that there are two groups in the data (it's a "bimodal distribution").  One group has petal lengths of 1-2 cm, and the other has petal lengths mostly between 4 and 6 cm.

### Making Better Histograms by Changing Bin Sizes

If you use the `hist` command, R will automatically split any continous data into bins so that it can be displayed as a histogram.  For the `iris$Petal.Length` data, R automatically chooses to split the bins every 1.5 cm, for a total of 14 bins.

Sometimes the bins R chooses are fine, but sometimes it would be useful to set them ourselves.  There are two ways you can control the bins in a histogram:

1. **Change the number of bins**
If you just want to change the resolution of your data you can set `breaks=number`, where `number` is the number of bars you want in your histogram.  For example, `hist(iris$Petal.Length, breaks=30)` would create a histogram of Petal Length from the `iris` dataset with 30 bars.  R will still automatically choose where to put the breaks:

```{r}
hist(iris$Petal.Length, breaks=30)
```

This can be useful if you want more detailed information about the data but don't particularly care exactly where the breaks are.

2. **Choose the breakpoints yourself**
If you want to control exactly where the breaks are, you can use a vector to list all the breaks you want.

For example:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(iris$Petal.Length, breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7) )
```

## Logarithms and Log Scaling

Working with data with wide ranges (such as sequencing data) often involves expressing values on a log scale.

Here is a video describing logarithmic scales.  This video was produced by [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org) and is shared using the [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/).

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xfOq00BzJA)

Log scaling is useful for dealing with data that covers a wide range of values - too wide to be displayed effectively on a linear scale.  One example of this data is income.  Often the richest person in a population makes much, much more money than the vast majority of the population.  If you plot that on a histogram, it ends up looking like this:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(income)
```

This income data is from a 1990 census of Los Angeles and Long Beach.  The [complete dataset and more information](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/IPUMS+Census+Database) can be found at the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

In this dataset there are a few people who made nearly \$1,000,000, but the vast majority of people made less that \$100,000.  This isn't too surprising, but plotting the data on a linear scale makes it impossible to tell the difference between someone making \$0 and someone making \$50,000.  We don't get a very good impression of how much money a typical person is making, we only get to see the extremes.

We can instead plot the data on a logarithmic scale and get a better idea of how it's distributed.  Log10 is useful because it's easier for us to think about.  The easiest way to do this is by taking the log of the data using the `log10` command, and then plotting using the `hist` command.  We can combine those into a single command:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(log10(income))
```

This is a more informative graph, it tells use that about 3000 people are making between 10^4 and 10^4.5 (\$10,000-\$31622), and about 4000 people are making between 10^4.5 and 10^5 (\$31622-\$100,000).  A few hundred people are making either 10^3.5 to 10^4 (\$3162-\$10,000) or 10^5 to 10^5.5 (\$100,000-\$316228).  And not very many people are making more than \$316228 or less that \$3162.

If we wanted more detailed information, we could change the number of bins in our histogram:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(log10(income), breaks=24)
```

### Be careful with zeros!

One this that is absent from our log graph is all the people making \$0.  That's because log(0) is undefined.  We can fix this by adding \$0.10 to everyone's income:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
hist(log10(income+0.1))
```

The bar at -1 contains all the people making \$0 (log10 of 0.1 is -1).  In this case it turns out not to be a big deal, there aren't too many people making \$0.  But you do have to be careful when log scaling data not to forget about the zeroes.

## Summary

- Histograms are a great way to get a quick picture of your data.
- Adjusting the bin size of the histogram can give you a clearer understanding of your data.
- Data with wide ranges can easily be visualized on a histogram using log-scaling
  - Be careful with zeros!
