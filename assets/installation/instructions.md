## 1. Install base R
You can download R from the [CRAN repository](https://cran.rstudio.com). Choose your operating system, then download the most recent release of R. Once you’ve downloaded the file, double-click to run it, and it should walk you through the R installation wizard. If you’re not sure about any of the options, choosing the default is a good idea.

## 2. Install RStudio
Download RStudio from the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Find RStudio Desktop, which is completely free, and click the Download button. Once you’ve downloaded the file, double-click to run it, and it should walk you through the R installation wizard. If you’re not sure about any of the options, choosing the default is a good idea.

## 3. Start Up R and RStudio
Once you’ve installed RStudio you should be able to find and run it just like any other program. You can search for it in the search bar, or find it under the Start Menu (for Windows) or Applications (for Mac).

## 4. Run the install script to install additional required packages:
Download and save the Clovis_Student_Installation.R file.  Within RStudio, open the install script (File > Open File > wherever you saved it).  It should open up within the top left panel of RStudio.  There should be a "Source" button in that panel as well - click the Source button.  This will attempt to install the R packages - you should see a bunch of text scroll by in the R console (bottom left panel).  If it asks if you want to update all/some/none, choose none.  It took about 5 minutes when I ran it from scratch, this will depend somewhat on your internet speed and computer speed.
